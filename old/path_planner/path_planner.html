                        <p> A useful, and dynamic path planner that works is a rarity. Yet, side projects, industry, and
                            everything in between can benefit from a platform that can perform path planning
                            efficiently. These ROS2 packages plan to implement this by reading SLAM map files, and
                            publishing interactive markers in RVIZ to dynamically plan paths from the start node to the
                            goal node. We utilize the a-star algorithm, as it is one of the most common for finding
                            shortest paths.

                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>Most map files are in the .pgm and .yaml pair formats. The current iteration of these
                            packages read the map from a PNG file instead. A PNG is lightweight, easily convertible, and
                            most importantly easy to read. There is no metadata to access, you can simply use OpenCV to
                            loop through each pixel. We read the pixels from the PNG map file and publish them on an
                            occupancy_grid topic, which is then displayed in RVIZ on the /map fixed frame. This sets the
                            stage for planning paths, where the white space is free, and the dark spaces are occupied.

                        <p>The A algorithm* is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that efficiently
                            finds the shortest path between
                            two points by combining the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm (guaranteed shortest path) and
                            greedy best-first search
                            (heuristic-based efficiency). It is ideal for path planning because it uses a heuristic
                            function to estimate the cost to the goal, making it faster
                            and more efficient than algorithms that explore all possible paths blindly. The algorithm
                            works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to explore, prioritizing those with the
                            lowest total cost
                            (known cost from the start + estimated cost to the goal), and iteratively expanding the most
                            promising paths until the
                            goal is reached.

                            can visualize the updates to the path in real time. Although the environment is static, this
                            could be a great tool for others to use in factory, warehouse, or other semi controlled
