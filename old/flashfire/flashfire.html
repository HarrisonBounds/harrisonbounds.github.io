            FlashFire is a group project that successfully produced an autonomous RC Car that could navigate any course
            using <b>Imitation Learning</b>.
            Imitation Learning works by having an "expert" perform the task a number of times and having the target (in
            this case an RC Car) learn from the expert.
            This was achieved by creating a custom <b>Convolutional Neural Network</b> to label each image being
            captured during training, and assigning that image
            a throttle value and steering value.
          </p>

        <h2>Hardware</h2>

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            The brain of this project was provided by the <b>Raspberry Pi 4</b>. Attached to the Pi was a webcam that
            captured 20 images per second so the
            network had ample training data. Along with this, a servo was attached to <b>PCA9685</b> servo driver to
            control the front two wheels. A motor was also
            attached to the PI, with everything being powered by a rechargeable LiPo battery. A custom 2-tier acrylic
            frame sat on top of the wheels that held all of
            the electronics in place.

        <h2>Donkey Car</h2>

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            This project was built off a platform known as <b>Donkey Car</b>. <a
              href="https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar" target="_blank">DonkeyCar</a> is an open-source platform for
            building self-driving scale model cars, designed as an accessible entry point to autonomous
            vehicle development. It combines hardware, such as a 1/10th scale RC car, Raspberry Pi, and various sensors,
            with Python-based software
            to enable machine learning and computer vision tasks. DonkeyCar utilizes deep learning frameworks like
            TensorFlow and PyTorch to train models
            for lane following, object avoidance, and more.
            <br><br>
            However for this project, we deployed our own Convolutional Neural Network to fit the specific needs of this
            project using <b>PyTorch</b>.

        <h2>Architecture</h2>

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            Flashfire's network is a CNN architecture designed for tasks involving image input, characterized by its
            compact
            and modular design. It begins with four convolutional layers that progressively reduce the spatial
            dimensions of the input while
            increasing feature depth, employing 5x5 and 3x3 kernels with strides of 2 and 1 to capture patterns at
            varying scales. Each convolutional
            layer is followed by a ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity. After the convolutional operations, the
            network flattens the feature
            maps and processes them through three fully connected layers, reducing the dimensionality step-by-step from
            a computed input size to 64,
            then 32, and finally to 2 output neurons (throttle and steering). This architecture ensures that the network
            is adaptable to different input sizes (defined by
            width and height) by dynamically calculating the fully connected input size based on convolutional layer
            outputs.

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            After moving the training images from the PI to a host computer, FlashFire is ready to be trained for an
            autonomous run on the course driven on.
            Running the images through FlashFire's CNN produces a model that is used as an input to the autopilot
            script. The script takes an image similar to
            the training process, runs that image through the model, and outputs a throttle and steering value for the
            car.
